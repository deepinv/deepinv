    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="This example shows you how to train various networks using adversarial training for deblurring problems. We demonstrate running training and inference using a conditional GAN (i.e. DeblurGAN), CSGM, AmbientGAN and UAIR implemented in the library, and how to simply train your own GAN by using deepinv.training.AdversarialTrainer. These examples can also be easily extended to train more complicated GANs such as CycleGAN.">
