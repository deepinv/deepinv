Introduction
------------
Deep Inverse is an open-source pytorch library for solving imaging inverse problems using deep learning. The goal of ``deepinv`` is to accelerate the development of deep learning based methods for imaging inverse problems, by combining popular learning-based reconstruction approaches in a common and simplified framework, standarizing forward imaging models and simplifying the creation of imaging datasets.

With ``deepinv`` you can:


* Large collection of `predefined imaging operators <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/deepinv.physics.html>`_ (MRI, CT, deblurring, inpainting, etc.)
* `Training losses <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/deepinv.loss.html>`_ for inverse problems (self-supervised learning, regularization, etc.).
* Many `pretrained deep denoisers <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/deepinv.models.html>`_ which can be used for `plug-and-play restoration <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/deepinv.optim.html>`_.
* Framework for `building datasets <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/deepinv.models.html>`_ for inverse problems.
* Easy-to-build `unfolded architectures <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/deepinv.unfolded.html>`_ (ADMM, forward-backward, deep equilibrium, etc.).
* `Sampling algorithms <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/deepinv.sampling.html>`_ for uncertainty quantification (Langevin, diffusion, etc.).
* A large number of well-explained `examples <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/auto_examples/index.html>`_, from basics to state-of-the-art methods.

Documentation
-------------

Read the documentation and examples at `https://deepinv.github.io <https://deepinv.github.io>`_.

Install
-------

If you can't wait until the next release, install the latest version of ``deepinv`` from source:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/deepinv/deepinv.git#egg=deepinv

Getting Started
---------------

Try out `one of the examples <https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/auto_examples/index.html>`_ to get started.

Contributing
------------

DeepInverse is a community-driven project and welcomes contributions of all forms.
We are ultimately aiming for a comprehensive library of inverse problems and deep learning,
and we need your help to get there!
The preferred way to contribute to ``deepinv`` is to fork the `main
repository <https://github.com/deepinv/deepinv/>`_ on GitHub,
then submit a "Pull Request" (PR).


Finding help
------------

The recommended way to get in touch with the developers is to open an issue on the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/deepinv/deepinv/issues>`_.
