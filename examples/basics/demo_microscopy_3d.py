3D diffraction PSF
=======================================

This example provides a tour of 3D blur operators in the library.
In particular, we show how to use Diffraction Blurs (Fresnel diffraction) to simulate 
fluorescence microscopes.

#
# 3D convolutions
# ---------------
#
# The class :class:`deepinv.physics.Blur` implements convolution operations with kernels. It will
# automatically work for 3D images when given 5D :meth:`torch.tensor` of size (B, C, D, H, W) for both
# the image and filter. Under the hood, the 3D convolutions are implemented through FFT.
# For instance, here is the convolution of a grayscale 3D image with a random grayscale filter:
filter_0 = torch.rand(1, 1, 3, 11, 8, device=device)
physics = dinv.physics.Blur(filter_0, device=device, padding="circular")
y = physics(x)

# Diffraction PSF generation
# --------------------------
#
# Advanced kernel generation methods are provided in the toolbox thanks to
# the class :class:`deepinv.physics.generator.PSFGenerator`, that we used to construct
# PSF generators for different type of microscopes.

# %%
# Widefield microscope PSF
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# We implemented 3D diffraction blurs obtained using scalar diffraction theory in
# :meth:`deepinv.physics.generator.DiffractionBlurGenerator3D`.
# Therein, the psf is defined through the pupil plane expanded in Zernike polynomials
# and the wave is propagated in the axial direction using the Fresnel approximation
#
# Let's generate 3 different 3D diffraction blurs. First, we instantiate the generator:


from deepinv.physics.generator import DiffractionBlurGenerator3D

psf_size_XY = 51
psf_size_Z = 35
psf_size = (psf_size_Z, psf_size_XY, psf_size_XY)


diffraction_generator = DiffractionBlurGenerator3D(
    (psf_size_Z, psf_size_XY, psf_size_XY),
    fc=0.2,
    kb=0.25,
    stepz_pixel=2,
    device=device,
    dtype=dtype,
)

# %%
# For optician physicists: ``fc`` is the cutoff frequency, which should be below 0.25
# to respect Shannon's sampling theorem,  ``kb`` is the wave number, used for propagation
# in depth. Letting ``NA`` denote the numerical aperture, ``NI`` denote the index
# of refraction of the immersion medium and lambda denote the emission wavelength,
# the quantities are related through:
# `fc = (NA/lambda) * pixel_size`.
# `kb = (NI/lambda) * pixel_size`.

# %%
# To generate new filters, it suffices to call the step() function as follows:

blurs = diffraction_generator.step(batch_size=3)

# %%
# In this case, the `step()` function returns a dictionary containing the filters,
# their pupil function and Zernike coefficients:
print(blurs.keys())

plot_ortho3D(
    [f[None] for f in blurs["filter"]],
    suptitle="Examples of randomly generated diffraction blurs",
)

plot(
    [
        f
        for f in torch.angle(blurs["pupil"][:, None])
        * torch.abs(blurs["pupil"][:, None])
    ],
    suptitle="Corresponding pupil planes",
)
print("Coefficients of the decomposition on Zernike polynomials")
print(blurs["coeff"])


# %%
# It is also possible to directly specify the Zernike decomposition.
# For instance, if the pupil is null, the PSF is the Airy pattern.
n_zernike = len(
    diffraction_generator.list_param
)  # number of Zernike coefficients in the decomposition
blurs = diffraction_generator.step(
    batch_size=3, coeff=torch.zeros(3, n_zernike, device=device)
)
plot_ortho3D(
    [f for f in blurs["filter"][:, None]],
    suptitle="Airy pattern",

# Finally, notice that you can activate the aberrations you want in the Noll
# nomenclature https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials#Noll's_sequential_indices

    (psf_size_Z, psf_size_XY, psf_size_XY),

    stepz_pixel=2,
    list_param=["Z5", "Z6"],
    device=device,
    dtype=dtype,
)
blurs = diffraction_generator.step(batch_size=3)

# %%
# Confocal microscope PSF
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# We implemented the PSF of a confocal microscope in :meth:`deepinv.physics.generator.ConfocalBlurGenerator3D`.
# In fluorescence confocal microscopy, the light emitted by the sample is filtered
# through a pinhole to prevent the collection  of out-of-focus light.
# The confocal intensity PSF can be expressed as
#
# .. math::
#
#    {\rm PSF}(r, z; \lambda_{ill}, \lambda_{coll}) = \vert h_{ill}(r, z; \lambda_{ill})\vert^2~ \left [ \vert h_{coll}(r, z; \lambda_{coll})\vert^2 \otimes_{2} D(r)\right ],
#
# where :math:`h(r, z)` is the amplitude PSF and :math:`D(r)` is the detector intensity sensitivity distribution (here : one inside the confocal pinhole, 0 outside).
# `ill` coincides with illumination, while `coll` coincides with collection. :math:`\lambda` coincides with the wavelength.
#
# See e.g. Gu and Sheppard, JMO, 1991  - Eq. (6) https://doi.org/10.1080/09500349114552311
