Use a pretrained model
====================================================================================================

Follow this example to reconstruct images using a pretrained model in one line.

We show three sets of general pretrained reconstruction methods, including:

* Pretrained feedforward :class:`Reconstruct Anything Model (RAM) <deepinv.models.RAM>`;
* :ref:`Plug-and-play <iterative>` with a pretrained denoiser.
* Pretrained :ref:`diffusion model <diffusion>`;

See :ref:`pretrained models <pretrained-models>` for a principled comparison between methods demonstrated in this example.
