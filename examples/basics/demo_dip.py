Reconstructing an image using the deep image prior.
===================================================

This code shows how to reconstruct a noisy and incomplete image using the deep image prior.

This method is based on the paper "Deep Image Prior" :footcite:t:`ulyanov2018deep` and reconstructs
an image by minimizing the loss function

.. math::

    \min_{\theta}  \|y-Af_{\theta}(z)\|^2

where :math:`z` is a random input and :math:`f_{\theta}` is a convolutional decoder network with parameters
:math:`\theta`. The minimization should be stopped early to avoid overfitting. The method uses the Adam
optimizer.

# We use image inpainting as the forward operator and Gaussian noise as the noise model.

# Generate the measurement
# ------------------------
# We apply the forward model to generate the noisy measurement.

# This method only works with certain convolutional decoder networks. We recommend using the
# network :class:`deepinv.models.ConvDecoder`.

# .. note::
#
#     The number of iterations and learning rate have been set manually to obtain good results. However, these
#     values may not be optimal for all problems. We recommend experimenting with different values.

# .. note::
#
#     Here we run a small number of iterations to reduce the runtime of the example. However, the results could
#     be improved by running more iterations.

# Run DIP algorithm and plot results
# ----------------------------------
# We run the DIP algorithm and plot the results.
#
# The good performance of DIP is somewhat surprising, since the network has many parameters and could potentially
# overfit the noisy measurement data. However, the architecture acts as an implicit regularizer, providing good
# reconstructions if the optimization is stopped early.
# While this phenomenon is not yet well understood, there has been some efforts to explain it. For example, see :footcite:t:`tachella2021neural`.
