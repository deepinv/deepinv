# ImageDataset

### *class* deepinv.datasets.ImageDataset(use_dict_output=False)

Bases: [`Dataset`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset)

Base class for imaging datasets in DeepInverse.

All datasets used with DeepInverse should inherit from this class.

#### WARNING
The tuple format is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. It is recommended to use the dict format instead.

We provide the function [`check_dataset()`](https://deepinv.org/api/stubs/deepinv.datasets.check_dataset.html.md#deepinv.datasets.check_dataset) to automatically check that `__getitem__` returns the correct format. We support two distinct formats for dataset outputs: a tuple format and a dict format. The dict format is recommended for better readability and flexibility, while the tuple format is provided for backward compatibility.

The tuple format is as follows:

* `x` i.e a dataset that returns only ground truth;
* `(x, y)` i.e. a dataset that returns pairs of ground truth and measurement. `x` can be equal to `torch.nan` if your dataset is ground-truth-free.
* `(x, params)` i.e. a dataset of ground truth and dict of [physics parameters](https://deepinv.org/user_guide/physics/intro.html.md#physics-generators). Useful for training with online measurements.
* `(x, y, params)` i.e. a dataset that returns ground truth, measurements and dict of physics params.

#### NOTE
When datasets are only composed of measurements `(y)` or `(y, params)` the tuple format returns `(torch.nan, y)` or `(torch.nan, y, params)`

The dict format is more flexible and allows for arbitrary keys. The only requirement is that the dict contains at least one of the keys `"x"` or `"y"`. Parameters used to update the physics should be returned in a nested dict under the key `"params"`. An example of a dataset returning a dict is as follows:

* `{"x": x, "y": y, "params": {"filter": filter}}` i.e. a dataset that returns ground truth, measurements and dict of physics params.

This check is also available for datasets using the method [`ImageDataset.check_dataset()`](#deepinv.datasets.ImageDataset.check_dataset).

Datasets should ideally return [`torch.Tensor`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor) or [`deepinv.utils.TensorList`](https://deepinv.org/api/stubs/deepinv.utils.TensorList.html.md#deepinv.utils.TensorList) so that they are batchable and can be used with `deepinv`.

If using DeepInverse with your own custom dataset, you should inherit from this class and use [`check_dataset()`](https://deepinv.org/api/stubs/deepinv.datasets.check_dataset.html.md#deepinv.datasets.check_dataset) to check your dataset is compatible.

#### check_dataset()

Check dataset returns correct format of images or image tuples.
