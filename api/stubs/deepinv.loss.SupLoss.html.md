# SupLoss

### *class* deepinv.loss.SupLoss(metric=None)

Bases: [`Loss`](https://deepinv.org/api/stubs/deepinv.loss.Loss.html.md#deepinv.loss.Loss)

Standard supervised loss

The supervised loss is defined as

$$
\frac{1}{n}\|x-\inverse{y}\|^2
$$

where $\inverse{y}$ is the reconstructed signal and $x$ is the ground truth target of $n$ elements.

By default, the error is computed using the MSE metric, however any other metric (e.g., $\ell_1$)
can be used as well.
If called with arguments `x_net, x`, this is simply a wrapper for the metric `metric`.

* **Parameters:**
  **metric** ([*Metric*](https://deepinv.org/api/stubs/deepinv.loss.metric.Metric.html.md#deepinv.loss.metric.Metric) *,* [*torch.nn.Module*](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module)) – metric used for computing data consistency,
  which is set as the mean squared error by default.

#### forward(x_net, x, \*\*kwargs)

Computes the loss.

* **Parameters:**
  * **x_net** ([*torch.Tensor*](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) – Reconstructed image :math:inverse{y}.
  * **x** ([*torch.Tensor*](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) – Target (ground-truth) image.
* **Returns:**
  ([`torch.Tensor`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)) loss.
* **Return type:**
  [torch.Tensor](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor)

#### *property* name *: [bool](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/functions.html#bool)*

The name of the loss function. This attribute is deprecated in favor of the class name and it will be removed in a future version.
