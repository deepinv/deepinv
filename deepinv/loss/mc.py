    Measurement consistency loss

    This loss enforces that the reconstructions are measurement-consistent, i.e., :math:`y=\forw{\inverse{y}}`.

    The measurement consistency loss is defined as

    .. math::

        \|y-\forw{\inverse{y}}\|^2

    where :math:`\inverse{y}` is the reconstructed signal and :math:`A` is a forward operator.

    By default, the error is computed using the MSE metric, however any other metric (e.g., :math:`\ell_1`)
    can be used as well.

    :param Metric, torch.nn.Module metric: metric used for computing data consistency, which is set as the mean squared error by default.
