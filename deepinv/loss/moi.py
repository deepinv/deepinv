    Multi-operator imaging loss

    This loss can be used to learn when signals are observed via multiple (possibly incomplete)
    forward operators :math:`\{A_g\}_{g=1}^{G}`,
    i.e., :math:`y_i = A_{g_i}x_i` where :math:`g_i\in \{1,\dots,G\}` (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12151).


    The measurement consistency loss is defined as

    .. math::

        \| \hat{x} - \inverse{A_g\hat{x},A_g} \|^2

    where :math:`\hat{x}=\inverse{y,A_s}` is a reconstructed signal (observed via operator :math:`A_s`) and
    :math:`A_g` is a forward operator sampled at random from a set :math:`\{A_g\}_{g=1}^{G}`.

    By default, the error is computed using the MSE metric, however any other metric (e.g., :math:`\ell_1`)
    can be used as well.

    The operators can be passed as a list of physics or as a single physics with a random physics generator.

    :param list[Physics], Physics physics: list of physics containing the :math:`G` different forward operators
            associated with the measurements, or single physics, or None. If single physics or None, physics generator must be used.
            If None, physics taken during ``forward``.
    :param PhysicsGenerator physics_generator: random physics generator that generates new params, if physics is not a list.
    :param Metric, torch.nn.Module metric: metric used for computing data consistency,
        which is set as the mean squared error by default.
    :param float weight: total weight of the loss
    :param bool apply_noise: if ``True``, the augmented measurement is computed with the full sensing model
        :math:`\sensor{\noise{\forw{\hat{x}}}}` (i.e., noise and sensor model),
        otherwise is generated as :math:`\forw{\hat{x}}`.
    :param torch.Generator rng: torch randon number generator for randomly selecting from physics list. If using physics generator, rng is ignored.
