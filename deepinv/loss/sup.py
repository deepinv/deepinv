class SupLoss(Loss):
    r"""
    Standard supervised loss

    The supervised loss is defined as

    .. math::

        \|x-\inverse{y}\|^2

    where :math:`\inverse{y}` is the reconstructed signal and :math:`x` is the ground truth target.

    By default, the error is computed using the MSE metric, however any other metric (e.g., :math:`\ell_1`)
    can be used as well.
    If called with arguments ``x_net, x``, this is simply a wrapper for the metric ``metric``.

    :param Metric, torch.nn.Module metric: metric used for computing data consistency,
        which is set as the mean squared error by default.
