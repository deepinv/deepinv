    Expected Patch Log Likelihood denoising method.

    Denoising method based on the minimization problem

    .. math::

        \underset{x}{\arg\min} \, \|y-x\|^2 - \sum_i \log p(P_ix)

    where the first term is a standard L2 data-fidelity, and the second term represents a patch prior via
    Gaussian mixture models, where :math:`P_i` is a patch operator that extracts the ith (overlapping) patch from the image.

    :param None, deepinv.optim.utils.GaussianMixtureModel GMM: Gaussian mixture defining the distribution on the patch space.
        ``None`` creates a GMM with n_components components of dimension accordingly to the arguments patch_size and channels.
    :param int n_components: number of components of the generated GMM if GMM is ``None``.
    :param str, None pretrained: Path to pretrained weights of the GMM with file ending ``.pt``. None for no pretrained weights,
        ``"download"`` for pretrained weights on the BSDS500 dataset, ``"GMM_lodopab_small"`` for the weights from the limited-angle CT example.
        See :ref:`pretrained-weights <pretrained-weights>` for more details.
    :param int patch_size: patch size.
    :param int channels: number of color channels (e.g. 1 for gray-valued images and 3 for RGB images)
    :param str device: defines device (``cpu`` or ``cuda``)
