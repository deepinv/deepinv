DeepInverse: a Pytorch library for imaging with deep learning
==================================================================

Deep Inverse is a Pytorch based library for solving imaging inverse problems with deep learning.

Github repository: `<https://github.com/deepinv/deepinv>`_.


Featuring
==================

* |:camera_with_flash:|  Large collection of :ref:`predefined imaging operators <physics>` (MRI, CT, deblurring, inpainting, etc.)
* |:book:| :ref:`Training losses <loss>` for inverse problems (self-supervised learning, regularization, etc.).
* |:boomerang:| Many :ref:`pretrained deep denoisers <models>` which can be used for :ref:`plug-and-play restoration <optim>`.
* |:book:| Framework for :ref:`building datasets <datasets>` for inverse problems.
* |:building_construction:| Easy-to-build :ref:`unfolded architectures <unfolded>` (ADMM, forward-backward, deep equilibrium, etc.).
* |:microscope:| :ref:`Sampling algorithms <sampling>` for uncertainty quantification (Langevin, diffusion, etc.).
* |:books:| A large number of well-explained :ref:`examples <Examples>`, from basics to state-of-the-art methods.
