Introduction
---------------

This package contains a large collection of forward operators appearing in imaging applications.
The acquisition models are of the form

.. math::

    y = \noise{\forw{x}},

where :math:`x\in\xset` is an image, :math:`y\in\yset` are the measurements, :math:`A:\xset\mapsto \yset` is a
deterministic (linear or non-linear) operator capturing the physics of the acquisition and
:math:`N:\yset\mapsto \yset` is a mapping which characterizes the noise affecting the measurements.

All forward operators inherit the structure of the :class:`deepinv.physics.Physics` class.

They are :class:`torch.nn.Module` which can be called with the ``forward`` method.


.. doctest::

    >>> import torch
    >>> import deepinv as dinv
    >>> # load an inpainting operator that masks 50% of the pixels and adds Gaussian noise
    >>> physics = dinv.physics.Inpainting(mask=.5, tensor_size=(1, 28, 28),
    ...                    noise_model=dinv.physics.GaussianNoise(sigma=.05))
    >>> x = torch.rand(1, 1, 28, 28) # create a random image
    >>> y = physics(x) # compute noisy measurements
    >>> y2 = physics.A(x) # compute the A operator (no noise)

Linear operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Linear operators :math:`A:\xset\mapsto \yset` inherit the structure of the :class:`deepinv.physics.LinearPhysics` class.
They have important specific properties such as the existence of an adjoint :math:`A^{\top}:\yset\mapsto \xset`.
Linear operators with a closed-form singular value decomposition are defined via :class:`deepinv.physics.DecomposablePhysics`,
which enables the efficient computation of their pseudo-inverse and regularized inverse.
Composition and linear combinations of linear operators is still a linear operator.

.. doctest::

    >>> import torch
    >>> import deepinv as dinv
    >>> # load a CS operator with 300 measurements, acting on 28 x 28 grayscale images.
    >>> physics = dinv.physics.CompressedSensing(m=300, img_shape=(1, 28, 28))
    >>> x = torch.rand(1, 1, 28, 28) # create a random image
    >>> y = physics(x) # compute noisy measurements
    >>> y2 = physics.A(x) # compute the linear operator (no noise)
    >>> x_adj = physics.A_adjoint(y) # compute the adjoint operator
    >>> x_dagger = physics.A_dagger(y) # compute the pseudo-inverse operator
    >>> x_prox = physics.prox_l2(x, y, .1) # compute a regularized inverse

More details can be found in the doc of each class.



Parameter-dependent operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many (linear or non-linear) operators depend on (optional) parameters :math:`\theta` that describe the imaging system, ie
:math:`y = \noise{\forw{x, \theta}}` where the ``forward`` method can be called with a dictionary of parameters as an extra input.
The explicit dependency on :math:`\theta` is often useful for blind inverse problems, model identification,
imaging system optimization, etc. The following example shows how operators and their parameter can be instantiated and called as:

.. doctest::

   >>> import torch
   >>> from deepinv.physics import Blur
   >>> x = torch.rand((1, 1, 16, 16))
   >>> theta = torch.ones((1, 1, 2, 2)) / 4 # a basic 2x2 averaging filter
   >>> # default usage
   >>> physics = Blur(filter=theta) # we instantiate a blur operator with its convolution filter
   >>> y = physics(x)
   >>> theta2 = torch.randn((1, 1, 2, 2)) # a random 2x2 filter
   >>> physics.update_parameters(filter=theta2)
   >>> y2 = physics(x)
   >>>
   >>> # A second possibility
   >>> physics = Blur() # a blur operator without convolution filter
   >>> y = physics(x, filter=theta) # we define the blur by specifying its filter
   >>> y = physics(x) # now, the filter is well-defined and this line does the same as above
   >>>
   >>> # The same can be done by passing in a dictionary including 'filter' as a key
   >>> physics = Blur() # a blur operator without convolution filter
   >>> dict_params = {'filter': theta, 'dummy': None}
   >>> y = physics(x, **dict_params) # # we define the blur by passing in the dictionary



Physics Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We provide some parameters generation methods to sample random parameters' :math:`\theta`.
Physics generators inherit from the :class:`deepinv.physics.generator.PhysicsGenerator` class:


.. doctest::

    >>> import torch
    >>> import deepinv as dinv
    >>>
    >>> x = torch.rand((1, 1, 8, 8))
    >>> physics = dinv.physics.Blur(filter=dinv.physics.blur.gaussian_blur(.2))
    >>> y = physics(x) # compute with Gaussian blur
    >>> generator = dinv.physics.generator.MotionBlurGenerator(psf_size=(3, 3))
    >>> params = generator.step(x.size(0)) # params = {'filter': torch.tensor(...)}
    >>> y1 = physics(x, **params) # compute with motion blur
    >>> assert not torch.allclose(y, y1) # different blurs, different outputs
    >>> y2 = physics(x) # motion kernel is stored in the physics object as default kernel
    >>> assert torch.allclose(y1, y2) # same blur, same output

If we want to generate both a new physics and noise parameters,
it is possible to sum generators as follows:

.. doctest::

    >>> mask_generator = dinv.physics.generator.SigmaGenerator() \
    ...    + dinv.physics.generator.RandomMaskGenerator((32, 32))
    >>> params = mask_generator.step(batch_size=4)
    >>> print(sorted(params.keys()))
    ['mask', 'sigma']

.. tip::

        It is also possible to mix generators of physics parameters through the
        :class:`deepinv.physics.generator.GeneratorMixture` class.


.. _physics_combining:

Combining Physics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to stack and compose multiple physics operators into a single operator.


Stacking operators :math:`A_1` and :math:`A_2` into a single operator

.. math::

    A(x) = \begin{bmatrix} A_1(x) \\ A_2(x) \end{bmatrix}

can be done with :func:`deepinv.physics.stack`. The stacked operator is

.. doctest::

    >>> import torch
    >>> import deepinv as dinv
    >>> x = torch.rand((1, 1, 8, 8))
    >>> physics1 = dinv.physics.BlurFFT(img_size=(1, 8, 8), filter=dinv.physics.blur.gaussian_blur(.2))
    >>> physics2 = dinv.physics.Downsampling(img_size=(1, 8, 8), factor=2)
    >>> physics3 = dinv.physics.stack(physics1, physics2)
    >>> physics3 = physics1.stack(physics2) # equivalent to the previous line
    >>> y = physics3(x) #
    >>> print(y[0].shape)
    torch.Size([1, 1, 8, 8])
    >>> print(y[1].shape)
    torch.Size([1, 1, 4, 4])
    >>> physics4 = physics3.stack(physics1) # add a new operator to the stack
    >>> len(physics4)
    3

The measurements are stored as :class:`deepinv.utils.TensorList` objects, which can be accessed by index
(see the :ref:`tensorlist` user guide for more details).
The resulting stacked operator is a :class:`deepinv.physics.StackedPhysics` object, and has some useful
methods:

.. doctest::

    >>> print(physics3[0](x).shape) # access the first operator only
    torch.Size([1, 1, 8, 8])
    >>> print(physics3[1](x).shape) # access the second operator only
    torch.Size([1, 1, 4, 4])


.. tip::

    See also the custom classes :class:`deepinv.optim.StackedPhysicsDataFidelity` and :class:`deepinv.loss.StackedPhysicsLoss`
    provide easy ways to build data fidelity terms and self-supervised losses with stacked operators.


Composing operators :math:`A_1` and :math:`A_2` into a single operator

.. math::

    A(x) = A_2(A_1(x))

can be done by multiplying the operators:

.. doctest::

    >>> import torch
    >>> import deepinv as dinv
    >>> x = torch.rand((1, 1, 8, 8))
    >>> physics1 = dinv.physics.Downsampling(img_size=(1, 8, 8), factor=2)
    >>> physics2 = dinv.physics.BlurFFT(img_size=(1, 4, 4), filter=dinv.physics.blur.gaussian_blur(.2))
    >>> physics = physics2 * physics1
    >>> y = physics(x) # equivalent to y = physics2(physics1.A(x))
    >>> print(y.shape)
    torch.Size([1, 1, 4, 4])
