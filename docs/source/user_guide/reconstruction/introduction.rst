.. _reconstructors:

Introduction
------------
Reconstruction algorithms define an inversion function :math:`\hat{x}=\inversef{y}{A}`
which recovers a signal :math:`x` from measurements :math:`y` given an operator :math:`A`.

.. code-block::

  x_hat = model(y, physics)

.. seealso::
  
  See :ref:`pretrained reconstructors <pretrained-models>` for ready-to-use pretrained reconstruction algorithms
  that you can use to reconstruct images in one line.

Defining your own reconstructor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All reconstruction algorithms inherit from the
:class:`deepinv.models.Reconstructor` base class, take as input measurements `y`
and forward operator `physics`, and output a reconstruction `x_hat`.

To use your own reconstructor with DeepInverse, simply define the `forward` method to follow this pattern.

Summary
~~~~~~~

Below we provide a summary of existing reconstruction methods, and a qualitative
description of their reconstruction performance and speed.

For the models that require training, you can do this using the :ref:`trainer <trainer>` and :ref:`loss functions <loss>`.

.. note::

        Some algorithms might be better at reconstructing images with good perceptual quality (e.g. diffusion methods)
        whereas other methods are better at reconstructing images with low distortion (close to the ground truth).
