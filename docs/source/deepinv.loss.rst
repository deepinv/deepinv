Loss
====

This package contains popular training losses for supervised and self-supervised learning,
which are especially designed for inverse problems.


Supervised Learning
--------------------
Use a dataset of pairs of signals and measurements (and possibly information about the forward operator),
i.e., they can be written as :math:`\mathcal{L}(x,\inverse{y})`.

    deepinv.loss.SupLoss


Self-Supervised Learning
------------------------
Use a dataset of measurement data alone (and possibly information about the forward operator),
i.e., they can be written as :math:`\mathcal{L}(y,\inverse{y})` and take into account information
about the forward measurement process.

Transforms
^^^^^^^^^^

This submodule contains different transforms which can be used for data augmentation or together with the equivariant losses.

    deepinv.transform.Scale

Network Regularization
----------------------
These losses can be used to regularize the learned function, e.g., controlling its Lipschitz constant.
