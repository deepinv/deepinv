Physics
=======

This package contains a large collection of forward operators appearing in imaging applications.

The operators and are of the form

.. math::

    y = \noise{\forw{x}}

where :math:`x\in\xset` is an image of :math:`n` pixels, :math:`y\in\yset` are the measurements of size :math:`m`,
:math:`A:\xset\mapsto \yset` is a deterministic (linear or non-linear) mapping capturing the physics of the acquisition
and :math:`N:\yset\mapsto \yset` is a stochastic mapping which characterizes the noise affecting the measurements.


All forward operators inherit the structure of the ``Physics`` class.

Linear operators
----------------
Operators where :math:`A:\xset\mapsto \yset` is a linear mapping.
All linear operators inherit the structure of the ``LinearPhysics`` class.
Linear operators with a closed-form singular value decomposition are defined via ``DecomposablePhysics``, which enables
the efficient computation of their pseudo-inverse and proximal operators.

Non-linear operators
--------------------
Operators where :math:`A:\xset\mapsto \yset` is a non-linear mapping (e.g., bilinear).

Noise distributions
-------------------
Noise mappings :math:`N:\yset\mapsto \yset` are simple ``torch.nn.Module``.
The noise of a forward operator can be set in its construction
or simply as

::

    import deepinv as dinv

    # load a CS operator with 300 measurements, acting on 28 x 28 grayscale images.
    physics = dinv.physics.CompressedSensing(m=300, img_shape=(1, 28, 28))
    physics.noise_model = dinv.physics.GaussianNoise(sigma=.05) # set up the noise
