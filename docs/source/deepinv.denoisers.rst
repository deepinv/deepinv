.. _denoisers:


Denoisers
==================

Denoisers are :class:`torch.nn.Module` that take a noisy image as input and return a denoised image.
They can be used as a building block for plug-and-play restoration, for building unrolled architectures,
or as a standalone denoiser. All denoisers have a ``forward`` method that takes a noisy image and a noise level
(which generally corresponds to the standard deviation of the noise) as input and returns a denoised image:

    >>> import torch
    >>> import deepinv as dinv
    >>> denoiser = dinv.models.DRUNet()
    >>> sigma = 0.1
    >>> image = torch.ones(1, 3, 32, 32)*.5
    >>> noisy_image =  image + torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32) * sigma
    >>> denoised_image = denoiser(noisy_image, sigma)

.. note::

    Some denoisers (e.g., :class:`deepinv.models.DnCNN`) do not use the information about the noise level.
    In this case, the noise level is ignored.

Equivariant Denoisers
--------------------------
The denoisers can be turned into equivariant denoisers by wrapping them with the
:class:`deepinv.models.EquivariantDenoiser` class.
The group of transformations available at the moment are vertical/horizontal flips, 90 degree rotations, or a
combination of both, consisting in groups with 3, 4 or 8 elements.

The denoising can either be averaged the group of transformation (making the denoiser equivariant) or performed on a
single transformation sampled uniformly at random in the group, making the denoiser a Monte-Carlo estimator of the exact
equivariant denoiser.
